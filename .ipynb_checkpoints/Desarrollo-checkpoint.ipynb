Tambien es importante el proceso de reducir las palabras a su origen con stemming o lematizacion para evitar analizar palabras cuya semantica es identica pero estan escritas diferentes producto de una conjugacion. En este caso se utiliza lematizacion ya que presenta mejores resultados que stemming al realizar el proceso considerando el contexto en el cual se encuentra la palabra."
